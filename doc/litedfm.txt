INTRODUCTION                                    *lite-dfm*

This is inspired by Sublime Text's distraction free mode.

COMMANDS                                        *lite-dfm-commands*

:LiteDFM              Enters distraction free mode.

:LiteDFMClose         Leaves distraction free mode.

:LiteDFMToggle        Toggles distraction free mode.

KNOWN ISSUES                                    *lite-dfm-issues*

If you change your colorscheme after the plugin has loaded, the cached
values for the line number coloring will be incorrect.

If your colorscheme has a transparent normal background, the LineNr fg color
will not be set in such a way to make it hidden.

ABOUT                                           *lite-dfm-about*

The current implementation does the following upon entering
distraction-free-mode:

  Hide the statusbar
  Hide the ruler
  Hide NonText foreground
  Enable line numbering
  Change the fg and bg colors for LineNr to the same as Normal bg
  Change the fg and bg colors for FoldColumn to the same as Normal bg
  For each window, change the width of the line number column to 10
  For each window, change the width of the foldcolumns to 12
  Revert to original settings upon closing distraction-free-mode
