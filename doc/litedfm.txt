INTRODUCTION                                    *lite-dfm*

This is inspired by Sublime Text's distraction free mode.


COMMANDS                                        *lite-dfm-commands*

:LiteDFM              Enters distraction free mode.

:LiteDFMClose         Leaves distraction free mode.

:LiteDFMToggle        Toggles distraction free mode.

CUSTOMIZING                                     *lite-dfm-customizing*

You can manually specify the color to be used for hiding UI elements. There
are two global variables that can be used to override the one that is normally
detected. One is for CLI Vim, while the other is for gui Vim. You can set
these in your vimrc like so:

  let g:lite_dfm_normal_bg_cterm = 234
  let g:lite_dfm_normal_bg_gui = '#abcabc'

If you are using a value of none for your background color, this is the only
way you will be able to make this plugin properly hide your UI elements.

KNOWN ISSUES                                    *lite-dfm-issues*

If you change your colorscheme after the plugin has loaded, the cached
values for the line number coloring will be incorrect.

ABOUT                                           *lite-dfm-about*

The current implementation does the following upon entering
distraction-free-mode:

  Hide the statusbar
  Hide the ruler
  Hide NonText foreground
  Enable line numbering
  Change the fg and bg colors for LineNr to the same as Normal bg
  Change the fg and bg colors for FoldColumn to the same as Normal bg
  For each window, change the width of the line number column to 10
  For each window, change the width of the foldcolumns to 12
  Revert to original settings upon closing distraction-free-mode
