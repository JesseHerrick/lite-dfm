INTRODUCTION                                    *lite-dfm*

This is inspired by Sublime Text's distraction free mode.


COMMANDS                                        *lite-dfm-commands*

:LiteDFM              Enters distraction free mode.

:LiteDFMClose         Leaves distraction free mode.

:LiteDFMToggle        Toggles distraction free mode.

CUSTOMIZING                                     *lite-dfm-customizing*
You can manually specify the color to be used for hiding UI elements. There
are two global variables that can be used to override the one that is normally
detected. One is for CLI Vim, while the other is for gui Vim. You can set
these in your vimrc like so:

    let g:lite_dfm_normal_bg_cterm = 234
    let g:lite_dfm_normal_bg_gui = '#abcabc'

If you are using a value of none for your background color, this is the only
way you will be able to make this plugin properly hide your UI elements.

You can also specify exactly how many columns from the left you want to
offset for DFM. Any integer between 1 and 22 (inclusive) is a valid value.
This value default to 22 if not specified.

    let g:lite_dfm_left_offset = 12

KNOWN ISSUES                                    *lite-dfm-issues*

If you change your colorscheme after the plugin has loaded, the cached
values for the line number coloring will be incorrect.

ABOUT                                           *lite-dfm-about*

The current implementation does the following upon entering
distraction-free-mode:

    Hide the statusbar
    Hide the ruler
    Enable line numbering
    Change the fg and bg colors for LineNr to the same as Normal bg
    Change the fg and bg colors for FoldColumn to the same as Normal bg
    Change the fg and bg colors for NonText to the same as Normal bg
    For each window, change the width of the line number and fold columns to
      match the specified offset (default: 22)
    Revert to original settings upon closing distraction-free-mode
